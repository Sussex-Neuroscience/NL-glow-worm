note on work in progress:

Seems mouse sensors using for optical flow detection are extremelly hard to come by in small quantities. I started [this thread](https://forum.openhardware.science/t/tracking-movement-with-a-computer-mouse-help/2834) on the GOSH Forum and some people have chipped in with ideas/suggestions and resources.

In the meantime I bought a cheap Ebay mouse to take it apart and see if we could learn something from the parts/components and if it would work as well on styrofoam spheres.
