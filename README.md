note on work in progress:


26/04/2021
Seems mouse sensors using for optical flow detection are extremelly hard to come by in small quantities. I started [this thread](https://forum.openhardware.science/t/tracking-movement-with-a-computer-mouse-help/2834) on the GOSH Forum and some people have chipped in with ideas/suggestions and resources.

In the meantime I bought a cheap Ebay mouse to take it apart and see if we could learn something from the parts/components and if it would work as well on styrofoam spheres.

## SCAD Files
Contains the trackball support SCAD file. Current version has indents for mounts. More will follow...

## Trackball program
A small standalone program which reads the movement of the cursor (motion in x controls rotational motion (orientation angle), changes in y translational movement). Stop the script with SPACE. 

####COMMENTS FROM SOFIA
- You probably know this one already, but Mikkel suggested [this sensor](https://www.pixart.com/products-detail/74/PAA5100JE-Q) which is available from next week. The issue is that it seems to work with white light and we can't find the specs on the spectrum it could work with. Perhaps it could also capture infrared? Any way to know that?
