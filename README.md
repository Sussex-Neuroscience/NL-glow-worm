# NL-glow-worm
A tracking and stimulation system for glow worms

### Aims
This set-up was design to investigate male glow-worms attraction to a stimulus that mimics the female’s glow. The aim was to be able to do so in tethered animals, whose behavior can be recorded at all times. Furthermore, we intended to have the ability to fully control the stimulus position relative to the glow-worm, as well as other characteristics such as intensity (brightness) and the duration of presentation.


## Set-up schematics

### General description
In summary, the set-up consists in a tethered male glow-worm, walking on top of polystyrene ball supported by an air cushion. As the insect walks, the ball moves beneath it and its movements are recorded by two optical mice sensors, placed close to the ball and orthogonally to each other. Each optical mouse is connected to an Arduino Due, in turn connected to a USB port. The optical mice x and y velocities are recorded by the computer, which are then analyzed in terms of translational and angular velocities.
The stimulus consists on LEDs with similar wavelength as the female glow, displayed as an array that surrounds ~ 180° of the insect visual field. The LEDs are attached to a controller and their intensity and duration of presentation can be controlled and recorded.

### Trackball and support

- **Trackball:** Polystyrene ball with 5 cm diameter.

- **Support:** Custom-made 3D printed structure, with a cup shape that covers the lower third of the ball and an opening at the center of the cup from which the air passes through.

- **Air flow:** Generated by a pump (Charles Austen, ET 80 pump, SepticsDirect, Weston-super-Mare, UK) and regulated at about X lpm (Futuris).

### Movement recordings

**Hardware**

- **Optic flow sensors:** Two optical mice (M500 Logitech, Lausanne, Switzerland) with sensors and relevant circuits detached from the remaining parts. The optical mice were placed orthogonally, with the sensor at the level of the ball’s equator and attached to the support with a screw.

- **Arduino Due:** Each optical mouse was connected to one Arduino Due, which in turn connected to a USB port on a computer. 


**Software**

- **Arduino IDE (v1.8.15):** For recording the x and y velocities of the optical mice, at ~ 60 fps.

- **Bonsai (Lopes et al., 2015):** For saving the information from the arduinos and a time stamp per frame in a .csv file.


**Additional recordings** 

- **Infra-red camera (ELP-USBFHD05MT-RL36-U, SHENZHEN AILIPU TECNHOLOGY CO.,LTD, China):** Placed above the set-up; connected to a computer via USB; recordings performed using Bonsai, which created a .avi file and a .csv with the time stamp of every frame.

note on work in progress:


26/04/2021
Seems mouse sensors using for optical flow detection are extremelly hard to come by in small quantities. I started [this thread](https://forum.openhardware.science/t/tracking-movement-with-a-computer-mouse-help/2834) on the GOSH Forum and some people have chipped in with ideas/suggestions and resources.

In the meantime I bought a cheap Ebay mouse to take it apart and see if we could learn something from the parts/components and if it would work as well on styrofoam spheres.

## SCAD Files
Contains the trackball support SCAD file. Current version has slits for mounts. Parameters:

`diameter` Diameter of the ball. Defaults to 44mm.
 - Glow worms: 44mm
 - Beetles: 100mm
 - Wood ants: 44mm  
`height="high"/"low"` Determines if 1/2 or 1/3 of the ball is covered.  
`inlet=true/false/"only"` Whether to include an inlet which can be glued underneath the holder. 

Currently the space thickness of the sides may need to be increased to make better room for the slits.

Also scad file for LED array (LED_line) - half circunfrence, 6 cm inner diameter, 0.5 cm thickness; with two rods to glue on the side for holding and rotating if needed (0.5 cm diam, 3 cm long)

## Trackball program
A small standalone program which reads the movement of the cursor (motion in x controls rotational motion (orientation angle), changes in y translational movement). Stop the script with SPACE. Ideally integrate two ortogonal optical mouse. 

Note: Tracking ball movement with camera also possible (see links bellow for FicTrac)
